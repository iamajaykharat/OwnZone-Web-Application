            <p>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on
                online services or over the Internet. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce,
                electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing,
                electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.
                E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the
                largest sector of the electronics industry.</p>

                <p class="lead my-3">Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part
                    of the transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail. Typical
                    e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books (such as Amazon) and music purchases
                    (music download in the form of digital distribution such as iTunes Store), and to a less extent,
                    customized/personalized online liquor store inventory services.</p>
